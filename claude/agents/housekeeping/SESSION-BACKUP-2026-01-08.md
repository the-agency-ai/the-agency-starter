## What We Accomplished

### Claude Cookbooks Integration
- Fetched and analyzed Anthropic's 63+ Claude Cookbooks
- Created local knowledge cache at `claude/docs/cookbooks/`
- Saved 10 most relevant cookbooks with Agency-specific analysis
- Created comprehensive summary document

## Key Cookbook Insights

### High-Value Patterns for The Agency

| Pattern | Benefit | Implementation Idea |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **Context Compaction** | 58% token savings | Auto-summarize long sessions |
| **Tool Search** | 90% context reduction | Semantic tool discovery |
| **Programmatic Tool Calling** | 85% token reduction | Batch tool operations |
| **Prompt Caching** | 2x faster, 90% cheaper | Cache agent.md/KNOWLEDGE |
| **Orchestrator-Workers** | Validates Agency design | Already implemented! |

### Proposed New Tools
1. `./tools/compact-context` - Auto-summarize when context grows
2. `./tools/find-tool` - Semantic tool discovery
3. `./tools/batch-analyze` - 50% cheaper background jobs

2. **Review:** Cookbooks for implementation ideas
3. **Consider:** Context compaction for long sessions
4. **Urgent:** Workshop token expires Jan 12!
5. **Still needed:** Workshop slides

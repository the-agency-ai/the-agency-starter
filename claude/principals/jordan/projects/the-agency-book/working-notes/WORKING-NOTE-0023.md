## Open Questions

1. **GitHub public or token?**
   - Public = more reach, easier onboarding
   - Token = controlled access, can track who uses it
   - Recommendation: **Public** — friction kills adoption

2. **Book pricing?**
   - $29 feels right for technical guide
   - $49 with extras for serious practitioners
   - Consider: launch discount?

3. **What's "done" for book?**
   - All 12 chapters?
   - Or "10 chapters now, 2 coming"?
   - Early access model might work

4. **Video content?**
   - Workshop recording = low effort, authentic
   - Polished tutorial = higher effort, more valuable
   - Start with workshop recording

---

## Minimum Viable Announcement

If we had to ship Jan 23 with minimal effort:

1. **GitHub:** Make the-agency-starter public
2. **Gumroad:** One product — "The Agency Guide" $29
3. **Discord:** Create server with standard channels
4. **Content:** Chapters 1-4 free, rest in paid book (even if incomplete)
5. **Announcement:** Twitter thread + HN post

This is achievable. Everything else is bonus.

## Summary

Want to have a couple of ideas for workshop project.

Want to provide them with suggestions that they can easily build in Claude Code. 

We need to be sure we have a tool that when run in root of the-agency-starter will allow me to create a new project.

We need to be able to easily get them setup and guide them through the process.

I am thinking a web app running locallly, that they can turn into a Turin deskop app. 

And then we guide them to deploying that web app in Vercel, etc.

## Details

Give me three ideas, that they can use to build by creating a request and then pointing housekeeping at the request.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Gets them building a project they can deliver
- [x] Provides 3 distinct project ideas with clear scope

## Notes

<!-- Any additional context, constraints, or preferences -->

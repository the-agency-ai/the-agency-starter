## Decisions Needed

1. **0001 & 0002**: Are these duplicates? Should we close one?

2. **0003-0009**: These are complete but have no tags. Should we retroactively tag them as `-complete`?

3. **0005 & 0006**: These are waiting on Jordan. What's the status?

4. **0010**: Bug service exists. Is this REQUEST complete or does it need more work?

5. **0011**: API Layer is Phase 1 done. Is this superseded by 0016?

6. **0012**: Log service exists. Is this REQUEST complete?

- `[x]` = Confirmed complete, close out
- `[CLOSE]` = Close without completing
- `[MERGE]` = Merge into another REQUEST
- `[CONTINUE]` = Continue working on this
- Add notes for any special handling

# The Agency Workshop Guide

## For Workshop Facilitators

This document covers running an Agency workshop — from pre-work instructions to the live session.

---

## Pre-Work (Send to Participants Before Workshop)

### Email/Slack Template

```
Subject: Pre-Work for The Agency Workshop

Hi!

Before our workshop, please complete this one step:

**Get a Claude Account**
1. Go to https://claude.ai
2. Sign up for Claude Pro ($20/month) or Claude Max ($100-200/month)
3. That's it!

Everything else happens during the workshop. We'll install all tools together.

See you there!
```

### Why Just Claude Account?

- Claude Code requires authentication with a Claude account
- We can't automate account creation (requires payment)
- Everything else (Claude Code, tools, setup) is automated

## Workshop Setup (Facilitator)

### Before the Workshop

1. **Generate a workshop token** (if repo is private):
   - Create a GitHub PAT with `repo` scope
   - Set expiration for after workshop ends
   - This token goes in the install command

2. **Prepare the one-liner:**
   ```bash
   AGENCY_TOKEN=ghp_xxxYOURTOKEN curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-agency-ai/the-agency-starter/main/install.sh | bash -s -- my-project
   ```

3. **Test the install** on a clean machine or VM if possible

4. **Have backup plan:**
   - Direct clone instructions if curl fails
   - Manual Claude Code install link: https://claude.ai/code

---

## Live Workshop Flow

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

- What is The Agency?
- What we'll build today
- Quick demo of a running agent

### 2. Installation (10 min)

**Put this on screen:**

```bash
AGENCY_TOKEN=ghp_xxx curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-agency-ai/the-agency-starter/main/install.sh | bash -s -- my-project
```

**What happens:**
1. Installs Claude Code (if needed)
2. Prompts for Claude login (if needed)
3. Clones and sets up the project
4. Installs recommended tools (macOS: via brew)
5. Asks "Launch The Captain now?"
6. Drops them into their first agent session

**Troubleshooting during install:**
- "Permission denied" → They need to run in a directory they own
- "git not found" → `xcode-select --install` on macOS
- Claude login fails → Check they have an active Claude subscription

### 3. The Welcome Interview (10 min)

Once in the Claude session, participants type:

```
/welcome
```

The Captain (housekeeping agent) runs a 10-minute guided interview:
1. Asks what they're building
2. Creates their first workstream
3. Creates their first agent
4. Quick tour of the structure
5. Builds something real (a simple tool)

### 4. Exploration (15-30 min)

Suggested exercises:
- "Ask your agent to explain the directory structure"
- "Run `./tools/find-tool` to see available tools"
- "Create a simple tool that does X"
- "Have your agent write a small feature"

### 5. Wrap-Up (5 min)

- What they built
- Where to go next (GETTING_STARTED.md, documentation)
- Community links (if applicable)

## The One Command

For easy copy-paste, here's the workshop command with placeholder:

```bash
AGENCY_TOKEN=__TOKEN__ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-agency-ai/the-agency-starter/main/install.sh | bash -s -- my-project
```

Replace `__TOKEN__` with your GitHub PAT before sharing.

## What the Install Does

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | Checks for git (required) |
| 2 | Installs Claude Code if missing |
| 3 | Checks Claude authentication |
| 4 | Checks recommended tools (jq, gh, tree, etc.) |
| 5 | Clones the-agency-starter repo |
| 6 | Initializes fresh git repo |
| 7 | Makes all tools executable |
| 8 | Runs platform setup (installs tools via brew on macOS) |
| 9 | Prompts to launch The Captain |
| 10 | Execs into `./tools/myclaude housekeeping captain` |

## FAQ

**Q: What if someone doesn't have a Claude account?**
A: They can't participate in the hands-on portion. They can watch and pair with someone who has an account.

**Q: What if the install fails?**
A: Manual fallback:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-agency-ai/the-agency-starter.git my-project
cd my-project
chmod +x tools/*
./tools/myclaude housekeeping captain
```

**Q: What if Claude Code install fails?**
A: Direct them to https://claude.ai/code for manual install instructions.

**Q: Can they use Claude Pro or do they need Max?**
A: Pro works fine for the workshop. Max is better for real projects with multiple agents.

**Q: How long should the workshop be?**
A: Minimum 45 minutes. Ideal is 90 minutes for exploration time.

# Get current principal name
#
# Usage: ./tools/principal
#
# Returns the principal name for the current system user,
# as configured in claude/config/agency.yaml under principals.
#
# If PRINCIPAL is already set in environment, returns that.
# Otherwise, looks up the current $USER in config.
#
# Why this exists:
#   - Maps system usernames to principal names
#   - Allows multiple people to use same machine with different principals
#   - Configured via claude/config/agency.yaml instead of hardcoding

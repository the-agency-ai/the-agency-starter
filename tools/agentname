#!/bin/bash
# Get current agent name
#
# Usage: ./tools/agentname
#
# Why this exists:
#   - Provides agent identity (separate from workstream)
#   - Supports one-to-many workstream mapping (agents → agent-manager + agent-client)
#   - Used for agent-specific state (backups, logs, etc.)
#
# Returns: agent name from $AGENTNAME environment variable, or 'unknown'

echo "${AGENTNAME:-unknown}"

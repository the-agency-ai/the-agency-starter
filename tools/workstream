# Returns the current agent's workstream
#
# This provides a consistent, pre-approved way to check workstream identity.
# When asked "What is your workstream?" or "Who are you?", use this script.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/workstream
#   WORKSTREAM=$(./tools/workstream)
#
# Created because agents need a standardized way to identify their workstream
# without permission friction from checking environment variables directly.

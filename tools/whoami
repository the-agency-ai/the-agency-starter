# Returns the current agent's identity
#
# Uses AGENTNAME environment variable to determine agent identity.
# Falls back to "unknown" if not set.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/whoami
#
# Why this exists:
#   Provides agent self-identification for scripts and prompts
#   Part of two-variable system: AGENTNAME (who I am) + WORKSTREAM (what I work on)


# Tool version
TOOL_VERSION="1.0.0-20260109-000001"

# Version check
if [[ "${1:-}" == "--version" || "${1:-}" == "-v" ]]; then
    echo "whoami $TOOL_VERSION"
    exit 0

echo "${AGENTNAME:-unknown}"

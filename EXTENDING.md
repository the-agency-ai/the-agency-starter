# Extending The Agency

The Agency is designed to be extended. Whether you want to add new tools, build custom services, or enhance AgencyBench, there are well-defined patterns to follow.

## Overview

There are several ways to extend The Agency:

- **Tools** - Command-line utilities in `tools/`
- **AgencyBench** - Desktop development environment in `source/apps/agency-bench/`
- **Services** - Backend services in `source/services/`

Each extension point has its own conventions and patterns described below.
